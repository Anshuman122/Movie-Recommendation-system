#**MOVIE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM**
Movie Recommendation System is a content-based recommendation project that suggests movies to users based on genre similarity and user preferences. Built using Python, the system uses a static dataset (e.g., TMBD movies dataset) and transforms movie genres into numerical feature vectors using techniques like Count Vectorization. It then calculates cosine similarity between these vectors to identify and rank the most similar movies. Key libraries include Pandas for data handling, Scikit-learn for vectorization and similarity computation, and Streamlit for building an interactive and user-friendly interface. Users can simply select a movie and instantly receive personalized recommendations. This project demonstrates practical knowledge of recommender systems, feature engineering, data preprocessing, and full-stack deployment of machine learning models.
